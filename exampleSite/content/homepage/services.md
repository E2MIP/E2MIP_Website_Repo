## Racoon

![Racoon](images/racoon.png)
Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that radiology would play a crucial role in the management of this new disease. Lung CT scans continue to play a key role in diagnosing the disease and, above all, in predicting disease progression. The analysis of radiology findings is therefore one of the major objectives – and key to an effective pandemic response approach. One of the obstacles to systematic and quantitative analyses of imaging data is the lack of standardized reporting. Traditional prose reports in particular are often not accessible to computer-assisted methods of analysis. Over the past few years, radiology has therefore witnessed the emergence of itemized reporting. Individual findings and measurements are linked to meta data which can be used to identify in a clear and reproducible manner how a specific finding was obtained, quantified, or deduced from other data. As the first project of its scope, the RACOON network will establish a nationwide infrastructure for the standardized collection of COVID-19-related imaging data and use them to fight the pandemic. Co-Project Lead Prof. Dr. Bernd Hamm, Head of Charité’s Department of Radiology, said: “RACOON enables us to collate the findings and data on pneumonia cases with suspected COVID-19 and use them for research purposes. It will be the first time that such large quantities of highly structured data will be made available to inform relevant decision-making processes in epidemiological studies, situational assessments, and early warning mechanisms”. Another aim is to make the data available for use with epidemiological early warning systems and medical assistance systems (including artificial intelligence-based systems

## Improving prostate and breast cancer patient care through validated diagnostics and artificial intelligence.
Both prostate carcinoma in men and breast carcinoma (mainly) in women are the most common forms of cancer in humans in terms of gender. For both forms of cancer, initial approaches to diagnostics using validated algorithms (= artificial intelligence) show great potential for improvement in both early detection and differential diagnosis.
All four radiological project partners have already established the so-called multiparametric MRI (= magnetic resonance imaging) of the prostate as a standard procedure and cooperate accordingly with their respective partners from urology and pathology. Likewise, all four project partners have intensive experience in the diagnosis of breast cancer with all imaging methods available for this purpose, such as mammography, ultrasound and dynamic (contrast agent-assisted) MRI. All radiological partners perform imaging of the female breast in appropriate clinical collaboration with gynecology and pathology. In summary, this results in a maximum of project-related preliminary work and competence. The combination of the four project partners for this project ensures above all that, in addition to the high level of expertise, a high number of validated data sets can be obtained quickly. The goal is to develop a disease-specific AI program for high-precision tumor diagnostics.
