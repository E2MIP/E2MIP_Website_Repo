##### Abstract
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare lymphoid malignancy with a poor prognosis characterised by frequent relapse and short durations of treatment response. Most patients present with aggressive disease, but there exist indolent subtypes without the need for immediate intervention. The very heterogeneous behaviour of MCL is genetically characterised by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression with distinct clinical and biological characteristics and outcomes. There is still an unfulfilled need for precise MCL prognostication in real-time. Machine learning and deep learning neural networks are rapidly advancing technologies with promising results in numerous fields of application. This study develops and compares the performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms and radiomics-based machine learning (ML) models to predict MCL relapse on baseline CT scans. Five classification algorithms were used, including three deep learning models (3D SEResNet50, 3D DenseNet, and an optimised 3D CNN) and two machine learning models based on K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). The best performing method, our optimised 3D CNN, predicted MCL relapse with a 70% accuracy, better than the 3D SEResNet50 (62%) and the 3D DenseNet (59%). The second-best performing method was the KNN-based machine learning model (64%) after principal component analysis for improved accuracy. Our optimised CNN developed by ourselves correctly predicted MCL relapse in 70% of the patients on baseline CT imaging. Once prospectively tested in clinical trials with a larger sample size, our proposed 3D deep learning model could facilitate clinical management by precision imaging in MCL.

#### Longitudinal CT Imaging to Explore the Predictive Power of 3D Radiomic Tumour Heterogeneity in Precise Imaging of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)

##### Abstract
The study’s primary aim is to evaluate the predictive performance of CT-derived 3D radiomics for MCL risk stratification. The secondary objective is to search for radiomic features associated with sustained remission. Included were 70 patients: 31 MCL patients and 39 control subjects with normal axillary lymph nodes followed over five years. Radiomic analysis of all targets (n = 745) was performed and features selected using the Mann Whitney U test; the discriminative power of identifying “high-risk MCL” was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The four radiomic features, “Uniformity”, “Entropy”, “Skewness” and “Difference Entropy” showed predictive significance for relapse (p < 0.05)—in contrast to the routine size measurements, which showed no relevant difference. The best prognostication for relapse achieved the feature “Uniformity” (AUC-ROC-curve 0.87; optimal cut-off ≤0.0159 to predict relapse with 87% sensitivity, 65% specificity, 69% accuracy). Several radiomic features, including the parameter “Short Axis,” were associated with sustained remission. CT-derived 3D radiomics improves the predictive estimation of MCL patients; in combination with the ability to identify potential radiomic features that are characteristic for sustained remission, it may assist physicians in the clinical management of MCL.
