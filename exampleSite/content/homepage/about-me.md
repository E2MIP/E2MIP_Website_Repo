Prof. Dr. Meinrad Beer is the Medical Director of the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology at Ulm University. After his professorships in Clinical Radiology (University of Wuerzburg) and Pediatric Radiology (Medical University of Graz, Austria) he has been appointed chairman of the Radiology Department (Ulm University) in 2013. His main research interests are non-invasive oncologic and cardiovascular imaging, especially new molecular imaging techniques including MR spectroscopy, Diffusion-Weighted MRI and Hybrid Imaging (PET/CT).

Prof. Ropinski heads the Visual Computing Group at Ulm University. Before moving to Ulm, he was Professor in Interactive Visualization at Linköping University in Sweden where he was heading the Scientific Visualization Group. Prof. Ropinski has received his Ph.D. in computer science in 2004 from the University of Münster, where he has also completed his habilitation in 2009.

The focus of the Visual Computing Group is on interactive visualization and visual analytics, whereby new insights are derived from existing data. Therefore, we develop and evaluate visual data analysis methods to make big and complex data comprehensible. Our results are new algorithms and interactive software. We apply our work in medicine and the natural sciences (astronomy, biology and physics) as well as in areas such as cultural heritage and disaster management.
