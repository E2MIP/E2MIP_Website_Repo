## Rules

### Submitted solutions
- The participants should submit a script that creates a container containing everything necessary for the training and inference. 
- A internet connection is available for the creation of the container, but not during training or inference. 
- The organizers might check the submitted code to ensure abides to the rules. The submitted solutions should allow for that. However, the submitted solution does need to be publicly available but might be secured, for example by a password given in the code. 
- No side information about the data should be used, i.e. no hard coding of cases, no pretraining on the datasets etc… 
- Pretrained models might be used if they are:
  - Not trained on the challenge data. 
  - Not made solely for the challenge. 
  - Publicly available and well-documented.
  
  In question, the organizers will decide if a model can be used. Please reach out if you are unsure. 
- Each team can submit one solution per task  to allow the execution of all submissions in a short time frame. Adaptations are possible if enough resources can be allocated. 

### Submitted Paper
- Each team should submit a paper along the final solution in order to participate in the challenge. 
- The paper should follow the good scientific practice. 
- The paper should be sufficient to reproduce the submitted solution. 
- The paper should explain the main ideas used for the final contribution. 
- We encourage adding preliminary evaluation results to the submitted paper. 
- We strongly encourage the discussion of the development process, of ideas that didn’t work out or were inferior. 
- Participants are welcome to publish their results after the challenge in any venue, however, there is an embargo on the official results from the challenge until the challenge paper is published. 
- Teams related to the organizers can contribute to the challenge but will be highlighted as such.

### Participation teams
- A team can either consist of a single individual or multiple persons. 
- Each individual can only be part of a single team. 
- Due to legal restrictions, it is not possible to participate for persons with affiliations to organizations in countries that are on the current embargo list for HPC from the USA or EU. If you think this might apply to you, please contact the organizers.
