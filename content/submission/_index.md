Submissions must provide a docker that will be run on local hardware to ensure a fair and comprehensive assessment of the required energy. For learning-based solutions, the final training run must be included in the docker file, non-learning based may opt for an empty training process. 

Additional details on the submission process (Homepage, requirements, how-toâ€™s and docker template) will be provided here in future.
